For clusters/genres/preselection, find prototypical songs (probably cluster centroids):
  - Song genre will not be the winner of centroids but a list of distance to all centroids;
  - Something user interaction:
    - Show prototypical songs to user, they might instantly see the subgenre, niche, appropriate label, and apply it to make it human readable to them;
    - Let users (try) to find prototypical songs themselves;
    - All this linked to the 3d scatter.
