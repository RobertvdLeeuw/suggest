    - Info about shit like "n suggestions until model update"
  - See history/suggestions
  - Plots (probably combined with 1 of the 2 above)
  - Login
  - Select model
  - DB stats (n songs embedded, space left, etc)
    - API call stats (for rate limit)?

Upload metrics

    - Trajectory
    - Params
    - Hyperparams
Upload suggestions
  - Constrain suggestions (no prev listened or recommended songs, 
                           just pick arbitrary date to test with hist)
API endpoints


Why not just one modelInstance with (hyper)params blob?
